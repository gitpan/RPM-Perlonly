Perl-RPM-Perlonly - Native bindings to the RPM package format, without needing rpm.

Version: 1.0.1

WHAT IS IT:

  Perl-RPM-Perlonly is a clone of RPM::Header written in only perl, so it provides
  a way to read a rpm package on systems where rpm is installed. Perl-RPM-Perlonly
  can used as a drop in replacement for RPM::Header, if needed also the other way 
  around.

  The interface is a tied-hash, there are some tags not provided by RPM::Header but
  avalible in Perl-RPM-Perlonly.

BUILDING/INSTALLING:

  This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
  To build:
    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make && make test

  If the RPM package passes all tests, then:
  
    make install

You may need super-user access to install.
